 *
 * MiscTA service commands:
 *
 * TA_MISCTA_READ
 * ==============
 * Reads a unit from MiscTA.
 *
 * data should point to a data buffer. size should be the size of the
 * buffer. If size is not sufficient then MT_TOOBIG is returned.
 * size is updated to the actual size of the unit. Note that a zero-sized
 * unit is possible.
 *
 *
 * TA_MISCTA_GET_SIZE
 * ==================
 * Retrieves the size of a unit in MiscTA.
 *
 * size is set to the size of the variable. Note that a zero-sized unit
 * is possible.
 *
 *
 * TA_MISCTA_WRITE
 * ===============
 * Writes a unit to MiscTA. The actual write may be performed directly or
 * at a later time, depending on recent activity. This function should be
 * used for variables such as run-time counters, logs or other data that
 * is usually updated more than once.
 *
 *
 * TA_MISCTA_WRITE_CRITICAL
 * ========================
 * Writes a unit to MiscTA. The actual write is performed directly. This
 * function should be used for variables that are critical such as a DRM
 * key, phone information, etc that is only written once and where it is
 * crucial that the data is not lost if e.g. power is removed right after.
 *
 * If several critical units should be written after each other then the
 * miscta_write_unit() function should be used instead to queue up the units
 * and at the end a call to miscta_write_flush() should be done to perform
 * the actual write.
 *
 * When this function is called then any variables written using the
 * miscta_write_unit()-function is also written.
 *
 *
 * TA_MISCTA_WRITE_FLUSH
 * =====================
 * Performs the write to MiscTA for any variables that were not written
 * directly by miscta_write_unit().
 *
 * It is NOT necessary to call this to have the data written. Any queued
 * variable is written when appropriate. This function is instead meant to
 * be used when writing several critical units. See miscta_write_unit_critical().
 *
 *
 * NOTE: To preserve the flash memory it is IMPORTANT that the correct
 * write-functions are used.
 *
 * Normally miscta_write_unit() should be used.
 * For a single critical unit miscta_write_unit_critical() should be used.
 * For several critical units then miscta_write_unit() should be used,
 * followed by miscta_write_flush().
